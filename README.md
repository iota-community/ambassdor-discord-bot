# Ambassador Program Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot for managing ambassador contributions, roles, and incentives seamlessly. The bot tracks Twitter activity, assigns points, manages roles, and handles referrals without requiring ambassadors to self-report.

## Features

### Twitter Activity Tracking

The bot connects users' Discord accounts with their Twitter accounts to monitor and assign points based on Twitter activity.

- **Supported Activity and Points**:
  - **Likes**: 0.5 point each
  - **Retweets**: 2 points each
  - **Comments**: 1 point each
  - **Impressions**: 0.05 point each

- **Tweet Monitoring**:
  - Listens to every tweet link posted in `#ambassador-tweets`.
  - If a tweet link is posted in `#ambassador-chat`, the bot verifies if the Discord user is the author of the tweet and assigns points accordingly.
  - **Point Eligibility**: Tweets are eligible for points for 72 hours after being posted on Twitter.

- **Emoji Filter**: A ðŸ¥’ (cucumber) emoji reaction applied within 24 hours of posting the tweet link in Discord will prevent points from being assigned.
- **Bonus Feature**: (Optional) Assign additional points for the top 3 tweets each epoch based on engagement.

### Role Reassignment

The bot manages roles by reassigning them every epoch (2 weeks) based on the users' accumulated points and XP decay.

- **Role Levels**:
  - **Novice**: 0-249 points, no decay
  - **Intermediate**: 250-749 points, 100 points decay per epoch
  - **Advanced**: 750-4,999 points, 250 points decay per epoch
  - **Expert**: 5,000+ points, 500 points decay per epoch

- **Decay**: Points are decayed based on the user's current role at the end of each epoch, influencing role reassignment.

### Referral System

Encourages ambassadors to refer new participants to the program.
- **Successful Referral**: 200 points awarded to an ambassador when their referral reaches the Intermediate level.
- **Continued Engagement**: An additional 100 points awarded when the referred participant reaches the Advanced level.

### Points Management

- **Manual Adjustment**: The Ambassador Management team (`Role ID: `) can manually add or deduct points using commands.
  - Example commands: `/add 500 @discordusername` and `/deduct 500 @discordusername`

### Leaderboard Display

Displays a leaderboard table within Discord to track ambassadors' points and ranks.

## Usage

### Step 1: Invite the Bot to Your Server  

1. Use the bot's **invite URL** to add it to your Discord server.
2. Ensure the server has a channel named `#ambassador-tweets`.
3. Assign the bot the necessary permissions, including:  
   - Read Messages  
   - Send Messages  
   - Manage Roles  
   - Read Message History  
   - Add Reactions  
4. Confirm that the bot is successfully added and active in the `#ambassador-tweets` channel.

### Step 1: Test Twitter Activity Points 

1. **Link a Twitter Account** 
   - Use the `/link` command to connect your Discord account with your Twitter handle.
   - Use the `/authpin` command to validate the generated pin

2. **Post a Tweet Link** 
   - Share a tweet in the `#ambassador-tweets` channel.

3. **Check Points Assignment**
   - Verify that the bot calculates and assigns points based on the following criteria:
     - **Likes**: 0.5 points each
     - **Retweets**: 2 points each
     - **Comments**: 1 point each
     - **Impressions**: 0.05 points each
   - Confirm that points are assigned only if the tweet is not reacted to with a ðŸ¥’ emoji within 24 hours.

4. **Test Tweet Time Cutoff**
  - Post a tweet in the `#ambassador-tweets` channel that is **older than 74 hours**.
  - Confirm that the bot does **not calculate or assign points** for this tweet.

5. **Test Unlinked Twitter Accounts**
  - Post a tweet link in `#ambassador-tweets` from a Twitter account **not linked** to the Discord account.
  - Confirm the following:
    - The bot flags the tweet as **unlinked**
    - No points are assigned for the tweet.

### Step 2: Test Referral System  

1. Use `/refcode` command to view your referral code, and share with anyone.
    - Ask them to input this value when joing the Server
2. Confirm the following: 
   - Once code is used by the referred member, points should awared to the referrer
   - 200 points are assigned when the referred member reaches **Intermediate Level**.  
   - An additional 100 points are assigned when they reach **Advanced Level**.  

---

### Step 3: Test Role Reassignment  

1. Allow an epoch (2 weeks) but for testing purposes you can adjust it to two minutes by changing the value of `epochInSeconds` on line 8 of the ready.js file in the events directory.
2. Verify that roles are updated based on the following point ranges: 
   - **Novice Level**: 0â€“249 points  
   - **Intermediate Level**: 250â€“749 points  
   - **Advanced Level**: 750â€“4,999 points  
   - **Expert Level**: 5,000+ points  

3. Check that XP decay is applied correctly at the end of the epoch:  
   - **Intermediate Level**: -100 points  
   - **Advanced Level**: -250 points  
   - **Expert Level**: -500 points  

---

### Step 4: Test Admin Controls  
1. Test point adjustments using the following admin-only commands:  
   - **Add Points**: `/add` command
   - **Deduct Points**: `/deduct` command

2. Confirm that only users with the designated admin role can execute these commands.
